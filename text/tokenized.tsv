alt.atheism,It	was	no	criticism	of	Islam	for	a	change	it	was	a	criticism	of	the	arguments	used	Namely	whenever	people	you	identify	as	Muslims	are	the	victims	of	the	attacks	of	others	they	are	used	an	argument	for	the	bad	situation	of	Muslims	But	whenever	deeds	by	Muslim	that	victimize	others	are	named	they	do	not	count	as	an	argument	because	what	these	people	did	was	not	done	as	a	true	Muslims	No	mention	is	made	how	Muslims	are	the	cause	of	a	bad	situation	of	another	party
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,Can	anybody	send	CONNER	CP	321	harddisk	specifications	It	has	612	Cyl	and	4	HD	but	I	am	more	intrested	in	its	time	out	values	precomp	etc
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,It	is	model	number	7033D	a	14	interlaced	28dp	BTW	if	you	have	a	number	to	contact	the	company	that	would	really	be	helpful	to	Thanks	for	replying	I	was	beginning	to	believe	that	I	was	never	going	to	get	a	reply	I	posted	this	on	the	netnews	bboard	because	the	first	message	I	sent	to	you	was	returned	and	I	didn	t	know	if	my	second	message	would	get	to	you
alt.atheism,I	am	not	Mathew	Mantis	but	any	successful	first	year	logic	student	will	see	that	you	are	logically	correct	the	other	poster	is	logically	incorrect
alt.atheism,There	is	no	notion	of	heliocentric	or	even	galacticentric	either
alt.atheism,my	previous	posting	deleted	The	poster	casually	trashed	two	thousand	years	of	Jewish	history	and	Ken	replied	that	there	had	previously	been	people	like	him	in	Germany	That	s	right	There	have	been	There	have	also	been	people	who	were	formally	Nazis	But	the	Nazi	party	would	have	gone	nowhere	without	the	active	and	tacit	support	of	the	ordinary	man	in	the	street	who	behaved	as	though	casual	anti	semitism	was	perfectly	acceptable	Now	what	exactly	don	t	you	understand	about	what	I	wrote	and	why	don	t	you	see	what	it	has	to	do	with	the	matter	at	hand
alt.atheism,So	the	only	way	you	can	tell	a	false	hadith	from	a	true	one	is	if	it	contradicts	the	Quran	What	if	it	relates	to	something	that	isn	t	explicitly	spelled	out	in	the	Quran	Also	the	Quran	wasn	t	written	down	during	the	life	of	Muhammed	either	It	wasn	t	long	after	but	20	years	or	so	is	still	long	enough	to	shift	a	few	verses	around	Karl
alt.atheism,Well	if	everything	wouldn	t	be	okay	then	tell	us	what	it	is	that	wouldn	t	be	okay	That	is	if	religions	were	no	longer	tax	exempt	then	what	would	be	wrong	with	their	lobbying	or	otherwise	attempting	to	influence	politics
alt.atheism,The	argument	goes	as	follows	Q	oid	quotes	appear	in	John	but	not	in	the	almost	codified	way	they	were	in	Matthew	or	Luke	However	they	are	considered	to	be	similar	enough	to	point	to	knowledge	of	Q	as	such	and	not	an	entirely	different	source	We	are	talking	date	of	texts	here	not	the	age	of	the	authors	The	usual	explanation	for	the	time	order	of	Mark	Matthew	and	Luke	does	not	consider	their	respective	ages	It	says	Matthew	has	read	the	text	of	Mark	and	Luke	that	of	Matthew	and	probably	that	of	Mark	As	it	is	assumed	that	John	knew	the	content	of	Luke	s	text	The	evidence	for	that	is	not	overwhelming	admittedly	When	they	are	from	about	200	why	do	they	shed	doubt	on	the	order	on	putting	John	after	the	rest	of	the	three	Sure	an	original	together	with	Id	card	of	sender	and	receiver	would	be	fine	So	what	s	that	supposed	to	say	Am	I	missing	something	That	John	was	a	disciple	is	not	generally	accepted	The	style	and	language	together	with	the	theology	are	usually	used	as	counterargument	The	argument	that	John	was	a	disciple	relies	on	the	claim	in	the	gospel	of	John	itself	Is	there	any	other	evidence	for	it	One	step	and	one	generation	removed	is	bad	even	in	our	times	Compare	that	to	reports	of	similar	events	in	our	century	in	almost	illiterate	societies	Not	even	to	speak	off	that	believers	are	not	necessarily	the	best	sources	In	other	words	one	does	not	know	what	the	original	of	Mark	did	look	like	and	arguments	based	on	Mark	are	pretty	weak
