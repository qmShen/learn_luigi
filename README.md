# Data Engineering 101: Building a Data Pipeline

This repository contains the files and data from the workshop as well as resources around Data Engineering. For the workshop (and after) we will use a [Gitter](http://gitter.im) chatroom to keep the conversation going: [https://gitter.im/Jay-Oh-eN/data-engineering-101](https://gitter.im/Jay-Oh-eN/data-engineering-101).

And/or please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly via email at jonathan@galvanize.com or over twitter @clearspandex

The presentation can be found on Slideshare [here](http://www.slideshare.net/jonathandinu/presentation-45784222) or in this repository (`presentation.pdf`). Video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny2X_WNxrB4).

> Throughout this workshop, you will learn how to make a scalable and sustainable data pipeline in Python with Luigi

## Learning Objectives

* Run a simple 1 stage Luigi flow reading/writing to local files
* Write a Luigi flow containing stages with multiple dependencies
    * Visualize the progress of the flow using the centralized scheduler
    * Parameterize the flow from the command line
    * Output parameter specific output files
* Manage serialization to/from a Postgres database
* Integrate a Hadoop Map/Reduce task into an existing flow
* Parallelize non-dependent stages of a multi-stage Luigi flow
* Schedule a local Luigi job to run once every day
* Run any arbitrary shell command in a repeatable way

## Prerequisites

Prior experience with Python and the scientific Python stack is beneficial.  The workshop will focus on using the [Luigi](http://luigi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) framework, but will have code from the following lobraries as well:

* numpy
* scikit-learn
* Flask

### Run the Code

#### Local

1. Install libraries and dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Start the UI server: `luigid --background --logdir logs`
3. Navigate with a web browser to `http://localhost:[port]` where `[port]` is the port the `luigid` server has started on (`luigid` defaults to port 8082)
4. start the API Server: `python app.py`
5. Evaluate Model: `python ml-pipeline.py EvaluateModel --input-dir text --lam 0.8`
6. Run evaluation server (at `localhost:9191`): `topmodel/topmodel_server.py`
7. Run the final pipeline: `python ml-pipeline.py BuildModels --input-dir text --num-topics 10 --lam 0.8`

--

**For parallelism, set `--workers` (note this is Task parallelism):**

`python ml-pipeline.py BuildModels --input-dir text --num-topics 10 --lam 0.8 --workers 4`

#### Hadoop

1. Start Hadoop cluster: `bin/start-dfs.sh; sbin/start-yarn.sh`
2. Setup Directory Structure: `hadoop fs -mkdir /tmp/text`
3. Get files on cluster: `hadoop fs -put ./data/text /tmp/text`
4. Retrieve results: `hadoop fs -getmerge /tmp/text-count/2012-06-01 ./counts.txt`
5. View results: `head ./counts.txt`

#### Flask

1. `docker run -it -v /LOCAL/PATH/TO/REPO/data-engineering-101:/root/workshop clearspandex/pydata-seattle bash`
2. `pip2 install flask`
3. `ipython2 app.py`

### Libraries Used
* [luigi](http://luigi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html)
* [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [nltk](http://www.nltk.org/)
* [ipdb](https://github.com/gotcha/ipdb)

## The Data

The data (in the `text/` folder) is from the [20 newsgroups](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/) dataset, a standard benchmarking dataset for machine learning and NLP.  Each file in `text` corresponds to a single 'document' (or post) from one of two selected [newsgroups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet_newsgroup) (`comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware` or `alt.atheism`).  The first line provides which group the document is from and everything thereafter is the body of the post.

    comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware
    I'm looking for a better method to back up files.  Currently using a MaynStream
    250Q that uses DC 6250 tapes.  I will need to have a capacity of 600 Mb to 1Gb
    for future backups.  Only DOS files.

    I would be VERY appreciative of information about backup devices or
    manufacturers of these products.  Flopticals, DAT, tape, anything.  
    If possible, please include price, backup speed, manufacturer (phone #?), 
    and opinions about the quality/reliability.

    Please E-Mail, I'll send summaries to those interested.

    Thanx in advance,
